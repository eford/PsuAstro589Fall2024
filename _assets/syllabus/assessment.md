## Assessment and Grading Policy

Assessment will be in four categories:
- Class participation: 40% 
  - Reading & Reading questions
  - In-class participation
- Presentations:  60%
  - Preparation:  20%
  - Prepared materials: 20%
  - Engaging presentation: 20%

### Readings & Reading Questions
Students will be expected to read assignments related to each class in a timely fashion, so they are prepared to participate in class discussions.  
Any students who are reluctant to ask questions in class are especially encouraged to ask extra questions prior to class.  


### Presentations
At least three weeks before their presentation:  
Student(s) should select a relevant sub-topic and propose (via a simple email with ASTRO 589 in the subject line) one to three articles that will provide the foundation for their presentation.  
The instructor may suggest removing or replacings sources and may require adding one one article of their choosing within one week of receiving a proposal.

At least two week before their presentation:
Once the primary sources are agreed upon, the student(s) should read the article(s) thoughtfully, prepare an outline for their in-class presentation, and submit the outline to the instructor.   
Submissions should be email (with ASTRO 589 in the subject line) and may be simple ASCII text, a link to a collaborative document (e.g., Google Doc, Overleaf document), or a PDF.  
Students are encouraged to schedule a time to meet with the instructor after they have had a chance to begin thinking about how to incoporate any feedback and building their presentation materials, so they can ask any questions and discuss ideas for what to their presentation.

Roughly one week before their presentation (and no later than 9am on the Monday prior to their presentation):  
Students should submit draft presentation materials via email with ASTRO 589 in the subject line.  Collaborative documents (e.g., Google slides, Overleaf, Google Collab) are encouraged.  A PDF is also acceptable.  Any presentations prepared in formats that require special software (e.g., Mac-specific formats) will have to be converted to something the instructor can easily open.


The above deadlines may be relaxed slightly for the first two student presentations, depending on the date of the first student presentation.
