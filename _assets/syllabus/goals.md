## Course Overview
Students will learn about the current state-of-the-art of Extremely Precise Radial Velocity (EPRV) exoplanet surveys, including observational and data analysis techniques for detecting and characterizing extrasolar planetary systems.  

## Course Goals
Successful students in the class will:
- Understand how extremely precise radial velocity (EPRV) surveys detect and characterize extrasolar planetary systems,
- Describe exoplanet surveys being conducted by Penn State faculty and how they related to the current state and future of EPRV exoplanet surveys, and
- Increase their skills for digesting journal articles and communicating scientific advanced concepts.

## Learning Objectives
Successful students in the class will:
- Describe how extremely precise radial velocity surveys detect and characterize extrasolar planetary systems.
- Describe the effects of exoplanets, astrophysical variability, and instrumental effects on EPRV observations.
- Critically evaluate the quality of exoplanet detections and mass and orbit measurements.
