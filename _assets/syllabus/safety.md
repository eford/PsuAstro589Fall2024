## Safety
While attendance and participation in class is important to the class and your learning, it is more important that we all stay safe and healthy.  
Any student who does not feel well or who may be contagious must not attend class in Davey Lab.  
If you are staying away from others due to health concerns, then you should let the instruction know in advance of class whenever practical and make plans to get a classmateâ€™s notes for any missed class sessions.  
Some class sessions may be moved online, based on community conditions or if the instructor or that week's presenter needs to quarantine or isolate.  
If you are scheduled to present and are unsure if you'll be recovered in time to present in person, then please let the instructor know as soon as possible, so we can make alternative plans, such as rescheduling or a remote presentation.
