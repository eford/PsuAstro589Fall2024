## Student-led Presentations & Discussions

The instructor will lead discussions for the first few weeks.  
Subsequently, each student (or perhaps small group of students) will lead at least one class discussion on a relevant topic of interest on their assigned date.  
All students will be expected to devote approximately one hour per week to reading and submitting questions/comments on the reading (typically via Perusall, see link from course webpage in Canvas).  
Reading questions and comments are due 24 hours before the start of class, so the presenter has time to incorporate these into their discussion plans.  

See the [presentations section of the syllabus](/syllabus/presentations/) for details about what is expected and the timeline for preparing your presentation.

Students are welcome to propose one of the topics above, a combination or variation on one or two of the topics above, or an additional topic that is of particular interest to them.  
Students should suggest at least one source for them to read and select portions for other students to read.  
See the [resources page](/resources/) to help get started finding some readings that might be relevant for your topic.
